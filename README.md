# Automatically skip disliked songs on YouTube Music
This is a bookmarklet version of the code. Copy it into a bookmark in your browser. Tested only with Firefox.

I have made the following modifications from the original code:

- Store as unformatted bookmarklet
- Change the delay from 1 second to 2 seconds for better reliability (not accidentally skipping two songs instead of 1
- Prevent accidentally creating extra copies of the action if I accidentally click the bookmarklet more than once in a given tab

If you, like me, have more than one tab open to YouTube Music, you will have to click the bookmarklet once in each tab. The bookmarklet only applies to the tab you click it in.
